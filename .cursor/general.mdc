# MODUS OPERANDI
- Your task is to help me build my AI Startup <project-name>.
- Avoid feature creep at all cost. Avoid over-engineering and overthinking.
- Always prioritize writing clean, simple, and modular code.
- do what the user asks for, exactly are precisely. nothing more, nothing less.
- stop trying to impress the user. the best thing you can do is execute his command properly & completely.
- Execute exactly what is requested, nothing more.
- Implement precisely what the user asks for, without additional features or complexity.
- Check that you've implemented every requirement fully & completely.
- Prioritize simplicity and minimalism in your solutions.
- Constantly verify you're not adding anything beyond the user's explicit instructions.
- Use simple & easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.
- DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB UNLESS THE USER ASKS YOU TO.

# CRITICAL RULES TO ALWAYS FOLLOW!!!
- Execute exactly what is requested, nothing more.
- Implement precisely what the user asks for, without additional features or complexity.
- Confirm every requirement is addressed explicitly.
- Prioritize simplicity and minimalism in your solutions.
- Constantly verify you're not adding anything beyond the user's explicit instructions.

# LONG FILES
- currently, our codebase has too many long files (400+ LOC).
- you MUST proactively look & identify these files, and suggest how to split them into smaller files in order to make our codebase more modular & better organized.
- look for the simplest and lowest-risk refactoring options first
- when refactoring a large file to make it smaller, ALWAYS only suggest one new file at a time. do not suggest refactoring into 3+ files.
