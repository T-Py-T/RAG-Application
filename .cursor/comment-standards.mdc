# COMMENTS
- Write lots of comments in your code. explain exactly what you are doing in your comments.
- comments are just as important as the code itself.
- but be strategic, do not explain obvious syntax - instead explain your thought process at the time of writing the code!
- explain WHY you added each line, what is the broader purpose it serves.
- NEVER delete explanatory comments from the code you're editing (unless they are wrong/obsolete)
- focus on explaining the non-obvious stuff in the comments, the nuances / details
- DO NOT delete comments currently in our code. If the comment is obsolete, or wrong, then update it - but NEVER mindlessly remove comments without reason.

# HEADER COMMENTS
- EVERY file HAS TO start with 3 comments!
- the first comment needs to be the exact location of the file, for example: location/location/file-name.tsx (or .py or .md etc)
- the 2nd and 3rd comment should be a clear description of what this file was created to do. what IS and ISN'T the purpose of this file.
- NEVER delete these "header comments" from the files you're editing.
