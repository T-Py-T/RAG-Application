# Product Mission (Lite)

HomeScope is a real estate insights platform that helps home buyers evaluate neighborhoods by providing aggregated valuations, crime data, school ratings, and tax trends.

It serves prospective buyers and investors seeking safe, affordable neighborhoods with transparent cost-of-living details. Unlike traditional listing sites, HomeScope merges public records and market data and uses an LLM to filter for low-crime areas based on user preferences.
